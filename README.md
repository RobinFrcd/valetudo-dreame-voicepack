# valetudo-dreame-voicepack

AI Generated voice packs for Valetudo controlled robots.

Tested with Dreame L10s, sound list taken [here](https://github.com/Findus23/voice_pack_dreame/blob/main/sound_list.csv).

## Usage

1. `poetry install` to install
2. `poetry run jupyter lab`
3. Use the `GenerateVoices.ipynb` notebook with our own `VOICE_ID`, `FY_USER` and `FY_PWD`
4. Run the notebook to generate the wav files and `./wav2ogg.sh voice_packs/mj/wav mj` to generate the tar.gz

You'll need `ffmpeg` and `vorbis-tools` to make the `wav2ogg.sh` script run.
